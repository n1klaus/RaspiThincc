# RaspiThincc

An Easy to use RaspberryPi Thin Client.
The idea is to create a simple, low cost, low effort thin client to be use it by anyone with any multi-session server like a Windows TS or RDS, for example.

How?
Well it will be based in a Raspbian Stretch Lite image, and the project itself will have a shell script to simplify the configurations and the dependencies installation (like a raspi-config style). 

It's based on:
  - OS: Raspbian Stretch Lite
  - RDP client: xfreerdp
  - Windows Manager: Ratpoison (an excelent lightweight maded by Shawn Betts)
  - GUI Windows for users and passwords and users acctions: Zenity and Yad (it just works)
  - Bootup customization: Pixel
  - Bash scripting... of course
  
  I made it once doing it piece by pice, Not "Fully automated yet". I will change the README wen it's functional
